# Join the Fun

## Instructions

Flatiron School has started its own taxi service, FlatironX, and we need to
start developing the application's domain model!

Three basic models have already been created, Passenger, Ride, and Taxi. Just run
`rake db:migrate` to apply their migrations to the database.

The next step is set up a "has_many :through" relationship between
these three models so that we can keep track of who's driving who around.
It will work like this:

`Taxi -< Rides >- Passengers`

This way, a taxi can have many passengers and a passenger can have many taxis!

Each table only has a primary key so you'll need to write a migration to
get the database ready to handle the "has_many :through" relationship.

Check out the join table section in the [Active Record Association Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#the-has-many-through-association).

Run the tests using the `rspec` command.
